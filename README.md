# SVGMaker

The SVGMaker aims to make the process of hand-crafting semantic, compact, logically structured SVG files easier.
It does this by offering a basic text editor and accompanying it with the following functionality:
 - A visual preview to see the results of your textual edits while you're making them
 - A visual interface to easily style, add, move around, and alter elements, in particular path elements
 - A fully-fledged terminal for the more complex functionality
 - Automatic saving throughout the whole process - don't lose anything when closing and re-opening the tab
