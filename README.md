# SVGMaker

The SVGMaker aims to make the process of hand-crafting semantic, compact, logically structured SVG files easier.
It does this by offering a basic text editor and accompanying it with the following functionality:
 - A visual preview to see the results of your textual edits while you're making them
 - A visual interface to easily style, add, move around, and alter elements, in particular path elements
 - A fully-fledged terminal for the more complex functionality
 - Automatic saving throughout the whole process - don't lose anything when closing and re-opening the tab

---
## Current feedback
 - doesn't seem to offer any edit functionality for non path SVG elements, non-style attributes
 - some kind of coordinates/alignment system in the visual editor would be nice

## Current todo
 - add visual interface for UI.bubbles.insert and UI.bubbles.remove
 - add save functionality for visual editor and terminal
 - add ctrl + Z and ctrl + Y functionality

## Future todo
 - improve text editor (syntax highlighting, indentation-related functionality)
 - add functionality for rect, circle, ellipse, ?line, ?polyline, ?polygon
